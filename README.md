Here is hopefully a more technical exercise to apply your knockout knowledge to. The purpose is to get a better grasp on important concepts via a slightly less simple hello world tutorial on knockout.js

The application has a couple parts. It shows a list of currently available car makes in the world (there are only 4, the world ended). Then it forces you to type in the car make you would like to learn more about.

This will then show a list of car models for that make. and you repeat the above process to show a list of features individual to each model. You have the opportunity to add or remove features from this list.

Happy coding!
